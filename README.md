## Two-Player Alternative Chess Game
To run the two-player chess game, open and run Chess.java in an IDE or through a command line. When a box appears asking if you would like to host or join a game, choose host. Next, run Chess.java again, the same way you did before.This time, when you get the same box choose join. 

You will now have two chess programs open, the host will have text at the top saying it is their turn, and the client will have text saying it's not their turn. On the host you may click on one of the white pieces to choose it, and click on another tile to try to move it there. If this is a valid move, the piece will move and control will be given to the client, otherwise the piece will not move and will become un-highlighted. 

Continue taking turns until one of the kings is captured, freezing the board and displaying a win/loss message at the top. To play again or reset the board in the middle of the game you can press the "reset" button on the top right.
