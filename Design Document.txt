We divided this prompt into three portions: Game logic, Game connectivity, and GUI.
Owen mostly worked on logic, Manjyot mostly worked on connections, and Ayden worked
on the GUI. 

We chose to write the solution in Java because it is the language we are most 
familliar with and it's properties of inheritance shine in the context of chess.
For example, we use an abstract class "Piece" that is subclassed by the specific
pieces and by doing this we can represent the board as a two-dimensional array 
of Pieces.

For the GUI, JFrame was chosen because Ayden had the most experience with it.
The visual board is implemented as a custom JPanel that can easily track mouse
clicks and button presses.
